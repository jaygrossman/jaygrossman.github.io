   <p>My name is Jay Grossman. I have worn a lot of different hats over the years &ndash; husband, father, son, entrepreneur, software developer, manager, mentor, coach, student, tag team partner, etc. All have shaped me in different ways and this site is where I plan to share those experiences on this site.</p>

Ever since I was 9 years old, I have been fascinated by how people behave related to collecting things and how they decide what they are willing to pay for it. At the time, I was in love with collecting baseball cards (as were many boys in the mid 1980&prime;s). So I would spend more time than reasonable trying to understand why a card that one person would buy for $1 could then be sold to another person for 50 cents or $10. Or why my friend who was a Mets fan was willing to pay 10x more for a Dwight Gooden rookie card than I would. It sparked interests into math, statistics, and basic economics principles. I was completely hooked.<br>
<br>
My interest in this problem space only grew as I attended college and beyond. That drew me to learning how to program so I could build software to further test my theories and find solutions. After searching for answers and not finding the solutions I was looking for, I have built some interesting projects that I have shared:<br>

<p>All of these projects were built from the ground up and each was created to fill specific need that I could not find in other sites (at that time period). Each has delivered different but valuable opportunities to explore different problem spaces.</p>
<p>These have allowed me to get hands-on experience for so many interesting technical and business topics&hellip;. customer service, predictive analytics, collective intelligence, market pricing algorithms, gauging demand, real time data/application integration, data mining, database design, implementing a search platform, content/document management, service based architecture, task automation, marketing, public relations, etc. Through these projects I&rsquo;ve met so many interesting, smart, passionate, and fun people &ndash; with the hope of helping them solve some of their problems/voids along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for taking a look and hopefully some of the topics on this blog will be worth the read for some of you.</p>
