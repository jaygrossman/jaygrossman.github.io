<p><strong><em>Below is the ridiculous retirement email to members of my day job's fantasy league. Hope y'all enjoy.</em></strong></p>
<p>To my friends and fellow competitors,</p>
<p>This is a tough thing for me to write, but I feel it is the right time. It is with some emotions that I am following in the footsteps of (the greatest tight end in NFL history) <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GronRo00.htm" target="_blank">Rob Gronkowski</a>, and announcing my retirement from fantasy football after 20+ years. Much like Gronk, winning another title last season was a physical + emotional struggle for me and I am looking forward to pursuing other interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel it is only fitting to offer a silly side by side comparison of Gronk and Grossman over the past 5 years:</p>
