 <p>I thought it would be a fun exercise to write a short document about what I index on for my day job and folks I work with.</p>
<p><strong>What matters most to me in a role:<br /></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Adding value to the world</li>
  <li>Building a sustainable business (legit P&amp;L)</li>
  <li>Learning personally</li>
  <li>Growing others</li>
  <li>Working with great people</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How I think manager relationship works best (from the manger perspective):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are responsible for your career progression!</li>
<li>I want to know your goals (if you can't express them succinctly, let's work on that together)</li>
<li>We are going to put in a plan to accomplish them</li>
<li>We are going to continually visit this plan to make sure:</li>
<ol>
<li>To understand the progress toward the goal</li>
<li>Where to make adjustments as necessary (maybe the goal changes)</li>
</ol></ul>
<p><strong>What if my goals don&rsquo;t perfectly align with our team&rsquo;s goals?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That &rsquo;s OK and somewhat expected. This will be a consideration of the plan we come up with together.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll look into overlap and see if the team can offer opportunities for growth with current or future initiatives.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If is it not a good fit, we can look for mentoring/networking opportunities from others inside or outside the org. Or even transition to another team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Style (Some things about me):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When possible, I gravitate to starting simple, seeing what works, and then layering on complexity.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I am blunt and direct! I will ask questions when I don&rsquo;t understand or agree with things. I may still ask questions when I do agree with things. I will tell you my opinion of ideas. My ambition is to validate/support my &ldquo;5 priorities for the role"&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consistent alignment of goals and clear success criteria for projects are important, and must be defined before we do production implementation. I am drawn to Metrics Driven Development.</li>
<li>While I will have opinions, I am open to how we get results.&nbsp;I am completely OK with someone proving my ideas/opinions are sub-optimal (in a timely manner, in the appropriate setting). Well thought out or super creative ideas can come from anywhere, not just exec/manager levels or subject matter experts. This is a learning opportunity for all of us!</li>
<li>Action biased! I am more concerned with getting the right results than sticking to process and being consumed with tracking JIRA tickets.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As technologists, it is our first responsibility to build the things that make the business successful. I vehemently agree with this statement I <a href="https://medium.com/hubspot-product/why-our-engineering-leaders-focus-on-product-over-process-26224aa4b36b" target="_blank">read in a blog</a>:<br /><br />
<i>"We believe that a predictable, reliable engineering team that builds the wrong thing is not a success. The engineering leader (and the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>engineers themselves) have to feel ownership and responsibility around what they are building, not just how they are building it."</i></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will not love working on every project we need to get done. Yes, on-call can suck (until we change things making it suck). There are some tradeoffs we will need to consider to help my goals of "Adding value to the world&rdquo; and "Building a sustainable business&rdquo;! I believe these are learning opportunities for us all and certainly worthwhile.</li>
<li>I prioritize the high impact, reasonable effort activities over the fringe use cases.</li>
<li>Project scope shouldn&rsquo;t change magically without discussion and agreement (especially requiring agreement by the team doing the work).</li>
<li>I work a bit on the weekends and at night. This is my choice.&nbsp;I do not expect that you are going to work off hours.&nbsp;I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.</li>
</ul>
