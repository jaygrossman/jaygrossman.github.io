<p>Way back in 1998, I came up with the idea of creating a database for collectors to track when they mailed out a letter to athletes asking for an autograph. I went on to launch <a href="https://www.sportscollectors.net/RequestIntro.aspx" target="_blank">autograph request tracking</a> as the key feature on <a href="SportsCollectors.Net" target="_blank">SportsCollectors.Net</a> in 2000 and it has been such a helpful tool for collectors.  So many of us have been able to track our successes and failures, and see how our collections grow.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning the SCN community hit a pretty significant milestone with 2 million successes tracked in our system.  For context, the community of 1000's of collectors enter an average of over 300 successes each day. It still sometimes blows my mind that so many folks enjoy using this system and what we have accomplished as a group.</p>

<h3>The 2,000,000th successes:</h3>

<table cellppading=5>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="https://www.sportscollectors.net/photos/933509.jpg"></td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

        received/sent: 3/3<br>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

<h3>Thanks to the community:</h3>

<p>To show our appreciation, I am extending the subscription of 100 members by 3 months.  We will be randomly selecting 100 active subscribers who have entered 10+ successes in the past 90 days.  If you are selected, you will receive a message from us with the details.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank everyone for all your contributions and for making SCN what it is today, you are all amazing.</p>
