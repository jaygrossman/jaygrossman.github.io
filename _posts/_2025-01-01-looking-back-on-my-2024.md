<p>Last year I wrote a fun post <a href="/looking-back-on-my-2023/" target="_blank">looking back on my 2023</a> with lots of pictures of my family and our activities throughout the year. Many of my friends, family members and coworkers told me that they enjoyed reading it, so I thought I would run it back with the 2024 highlights across the same 4 areas:</p>

<h2>Tech and Professional Things</h2>

<h4>My Day Job at Quanata</h4>

<p>In August 2023, I started as an Engineering Manager on the data team for Blue Owl, that was later rebranded as <a href="https://quanata.com/" target="_blank">Quanata</a>. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of State Farm, using driving (telematics) data to better understand and predict risk. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed my time within the tech and data orgs (smart + pleasant people and interesting problems).</p>

<p>My team is responsible for managing the company's data warehouse and data pipelines. We work on lots of interesting projects that involve data ingestion, transformation, visualization, complex calculations and serving up data products.</p> 

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2024_review/redshift_to_snowflake.png" alt="redshift_to_snowflake.png"  /><br/>
</p>

<p>One of our high priority initiatives we delivered was to fully migrate away from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/" target="_blank">Red Shift</a> to <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/" target="_blank">Snowflake</a>. Luckily, I have considerable experience with Snowflake and with migrating data platforms. We also chose to standardize on <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank">dbt</a> (for modeling) and <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" target="_blank">airflow</a> (for orchestration) as we migrated to the new platform. While it required a considerable amount of planning , testing and collaboration, this migration went rather smoothly and the cutover was pretty seamless.</p>

<h4>My Projects / Side Hustles</h4>

<b><u>SportsCollectors.net</u></b><br>
<p><a href="https://www.sportscollectors.net/" target="_blank">SCN</a> continues to be the coolest project I have gotten to work on! I am constantly getting to hear feedback from this passionate community autograph collectors. It continues lead to so much fantastic learning for me about so many aspects of running a direct to consumer business.</p>

<p>The site saw considerable organic growth in 2024 in terms of members, subscribers and content contributed by the community. Thank you to all folks involved.</p>

<b><u>Collectz.com</u></b><br>

<p><a href="http://collectz.com/" target="_blank">Collectz.com</a> is my fun data engineering and data sceince playground so I can better understand things about secondary markets for collectibles. TLDR - the platform helps me find arbitrage opportunities (buy low + sell high) for collectibles along a number of interesting features.</p>

<p>The big tech enhancement I focused on in 2024 was to support better organization of inventory for putaway and fulfillment. I wrote a blog post in August that detailed <a href="/inventory_cataloging_and_putaway_choices_for_my_sports_card_collection/" target="_blank">my move from fixed location to dynamic putaway</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="/inventory_cataloging_and_putaway_choices_for_my_sports_card_collection/" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/card_with_bar_code.jpg" alt="Inventory cataloging and putaway choices for my sports card collection" width="50%" /></a><br />

<h4>Italy</h4>

<p>Cindy and I went to Italy in 2005 and it was a memorable trip. We were excited to bring the family Rome and Florence in August.</p>

<h5>The Italian food is AWESOME!</h5>

<p>I LOVE LOVE LOVE Italian food and have been looking forward to all the great regional cuisine.</p>

<h4>Jack</h4>

<p>My son Jack recently turned 12 and is now in 6th grade. He loves playing video games with friends (he's gotten into Fortnite), building things, cooking and playing sports.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/jack_graduation.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
<small>Bon appetit, now we may eat!</small></p>

<p>Ever since he was 8 years old, he has been playing on our local travel baseball team (<a href="https://ridgewoodraidersblack12u.com/" target="_blank">Ridgewood Raiders</a>). He also played on a Rec Majors (5th and 6th graders) baseball team during the spring that I help coach -  we were the Texas Rangers but I am clearly not quite <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/bochybr01.shtml" target="_blank">Bruce Bochy</a>. It's been so much fun getting to coach and play with him - I throw a lot of batting practice and we have some epic wiffleball games.</p>

<h4>Jenna</h4>

<p>My daughter in now 15 and is a sophomore at <a href="https://www.bergen.org/bcthstc" target="_blank">Bergen Technical High School</a>. Her "major" is fashion, so she has sewing skills and can make things (I am jealous). </p>

<p>For the past 8 years, she has been studying and training in Tae Kwon Do. I am very proud that she attained her second degree black belt in April. She teaches classes and worked as a conuselor at her center's summer camp.  </p>

<p>She began bowling this year and made her school's JV bowling team. Even though I know very little about bowling and I know am not good, I have enjoyed watching her progression and learning more about the sport. I've taken her to a local bowling alley several times for some late night bowling and it is a lot of fun, even though she regularly beats me pretty badly and makes fun of my form.</p>

<p>A few years ago Jenna dressed up as Gene Simmons for Halloween and began liking KISS. My wonderful wife suggested that I get tickets and take Jenna to see them live before they stop touring. So we went in December and it was an absolutely amazing show. I still can't believe Paul Stanley (71) and Gene Simmons (74) could rock out like that for 3 hours.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">

<small>If you can dodge a wrench... amazed she went along with this for Halloween.</small></p>

<small>She got me tickets (and risked her ear drums) to see my favorite band - Parliment Funkadelic. George Clinton is 82 and was barely part of the show, but I'm still happy we went.</small></p>

<h2>My Collecting Adventures</h2>

<h4>Getting Organized</h4>

<p>I finally spent many hours getting organized and listed over 60K unsigned cards on buysportscards (my seller name is sportscollectors):<br>
<a href="https://www.buysportscards.com/search?sellerId=354fc7bb8e&sellerName=sportscollectors" target="_blank">https://www.buysportscards.com/search?sellerId=354fc7bb8e&sellerName=sportscollectors</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://www.buysportscards.com/search?sellerId=354fc7bb8e&sellerName=sportscollectors" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/buysportscards.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I accumulated a lot of stuff in the past 40+ years and I only had a very vague idea of what cards I had that were mixed up in many random boxes. After watching some videos of how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwauOPIIStU" target="_blank">Burbank Cards sets up their warehouse</a>, I got inspired to organize my stuff by sport, year, and set in 5000 count monster boxes. It has been a lot of fun for me to "shop" in my own store for cards, so no more needing to buy cards I already have.</p>


<h4>My favorite baseball card set</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://sportscarddatabase.com/CardSet.aspx?sid=41302" target="_blank">1911 T201 Mecca Double Folders baseball card set</a> consists of 50 cards that measure 2-3/16" by 4¾" when unfolded. The T201 baseball cards have two players printed on each card and can be folded to create a complete image of each. These cards were inserted into packages of Mecca cigarettes. The set features many of the greatest players of the era including Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Tris Speaker, Napoleon Lajoie, Ed Walsh, Chief Bender, Zack Wheat and Three Finger Brown.</p>

<p>The set has always been one of my favorites. I loved the old school drawings of the players and I thought it was cool that you could fold over the front of the card to line up the feet of the player on the back. I went to a card show in the 1980's with my dad and we bought the card featuring <a href="http://sportscarddatabase.com/CardItem.aspx?id=9493527&view=2" target="_blank">Hall of Famer Napoleon Lajoie and Fred Falkenberg</a> for $50 - it is one of my favortie cards in my collection today.</p>

<p>Ever since then, I have wanted to get the 4 cards featuring 2 Hall of Famers. In September I placed bids and was pleasantly surpirsed when I won the following two graded cards in eBay auctions:</p>

<uL>
<li><a href="http://sportscarddatabase.com/CardItem.aspx?id=9493516&view=2" target="_blank">Johnny Evers / Frank Chance</a> for $103</li>
<li><a href="http://sportscarddatabase.com/CardItem.aspx?id=9493508&view=2" target="_blank">Eddie Collins / Frank "Home Run" Baker</a> for $99</li>
</ul>

<h4>My favorite Autograph by mail</h4>

<p>Since I run a sports autograph community, I get asked a lot about my favorite autograph I get each year. My favorite TTM autograph of the year was finding Michael Pittman Sr. and getting him to finish up this Bucs leaders card from the season after their championship team:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.sportscollectors.net/photos/893913.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4>Collecting with Jack</h4>

<p>Some of my most fun childhood memories were going to baseball card shows with my dad in the 1980's and early 1990's. Unlike most of my friends, I was more interested in older cards from his heroes from the 1950's and 1960's than the newer junk wax era stuff.</p>

<p>Jack has started to show interest in sports cards this year and we went to a <a href="https://cardscollectibles.com/" target="_blank">local sports card show</a> a couple of times. It's been interesting to see him ask for so many players he has never seen play (except on youtube) - Barry Bonds, Willie Mays, Randy Moss, Babe Ruth, Pedro Martinez. He also does like all the super shiny modern cards of today's stars, so we go for some of them too.</p>

<p>One day he decided he wanted to try to slab his own cards. Since we are Sox fans, I dug out a card from the <a href="http://sportscarddatabase.com/CardItem.aspx?id=943883" target="_blank">1959 Fleer Ted Williams set</a> that I bought when I was his age. We spent a few hours on a rainy Sunday putting this together:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/scn_slab_1959_fleer_ted_williams.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There was some trial and error, but we think it turned out pretty nicely. The big authenticators (PSA and SGC) have nothing to worry about, as I have NO plans to offer a sportscollectors.net grading service.</p>

<h2>My 2023 Sports Fandom</h2>

<h4>Mixed feelings about my teams</h4>

<p>I am a die hard fan of the pro sports teams from Boston. I have been very spoiled about how much my teams have won in the past 20 years, so I am not about to complain about a frustraing year for my teams.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/2023boston.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2023.shtml" target="_blank">Red Sox</a> - I didn't have high expectations for this team and was pleasantly surprised by some of the guys (Bello, Yoshida, Duran, Casas, Turner). They contended for most of the season, but they had a terrible September and missed the playoffs. Seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDYko3jrnO8"  target="_blank">Tanner Houck take a line drive off the face</a> was scary, thankfully he came back. Hopefully Craig Breslow will be a better GM than Chaim Bloom, but I am not convinced.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2023.htm" target="_blank">Patriots</a> - This is the worst Patriots team since Dick MacPherson in 1992. The QB play has been awful, they don't have offensive playmakers, so many key injuries and they have not played disciplined. I miss the Brady, Gronk, Edelman days!!!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2023.html" target="_blank">Celtics</a> - The Celtics are a fun team and I like how Brad Stevens works to make the team better. Last season's loss to the Heat in game 7 was so tough when Jayson Tatum sprained his ankle in the first minutes. I like the Prozingis and Jrue Holiday additions to this year's team so far.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BOS/2024.html" target="_blank">Bruins</a> - They had the greatest regular season in NHL history last season. They had amazing offense to go with the best goalies in the league (Ullmark and Swayman). They were the prohibitive favorites to win the Stanley Cup. And then they blow a 3-1 lead to the Panthers in the first round of the playoffs. I think they will be solid this season, but they lost a lot with Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci retiring.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sad news about some greats</h4>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/mcginnis.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Until Lebron James came along in 2003, we had never seen an athlete quite like George McGinnis. He was 6'8, 235, super strong, great jumper and ran the floor really well. He won ABA titles in his first 2 years with the Pacers and shared the 1975 MVP award with Julius Erving. His per game averages were impressive that season - 29.8 points (led league), 14.8 rebounds, 6.3 assists (3rd in league), and 2.6 steals (2nd in league). Then he went to the NBA and immediately turned around a historically terrible 76ers team. He was so generous to fans + collectors and is one of my favorite players to collect - as I have every one of his Topps cards signed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/vida_blue.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bluevi01.shtml">Vida Blue</a> was a huge personality and a GREAT lefty pitcher for the back to back to back World Series champion 1970's Oakland A's teams. His 1971 season may be one of the best in modern baseball history as he won the Cy Young Award and MVP -> 24-8, 1.82 ERA, 301 strikeouts. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/wakefield.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The 2004 Red Sox were such a special team, as they finally beat the Yankees in the playoffs and won the World Series. The nasty knuckleball of <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wakefti01.shtml" target="_blank">Tim Wakefield</a> drove hitters crazy for his 20 year run in the majors. I remember seeing a game in Minnesota were the hitters were literally shaking their heads after watching it move all over the strike zone. He finished up with most wins as a Red Sox - and that is saying a lot since the team has been around since 1869.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/butkus.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dick Butkus was a badass middle linebacker. Even though his Bears teams were never great, he definitely was. The videos of him absolutely crushing guys over the middle are brutal but fun to watch.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/headers/iron_sheik_memory.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rip-to-wrestlings-best-bad-guy/" target="_blank">Iron Sheik</a> was the wrestling's best bad guy in the 1980's during my childhood. He was universally disliked by most fans, but he was a legit tough guy and incredibly entertaining. My first live wrestling match was in 1983 at Madison Square Garden when he beat Bob Backlund to win the WWF heavyweight championship.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2023_review/superstar.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In 1970's, the WWWF champion was Superstar Billy Graham. He was a true trailblazer with huge muscles, the super colorful outfits, some really funky sideburns to go with his receding hairline and so many great promo interviews. While he wasn't the most graceful wrestler in the ring, his style and promos were clearly the inspriation for Hulk Hogan and Jesse "The Body" Ventura a decade later. I got to see him a bunch in the 1980's and 1990's when he fully shaved his head and was in the NWA + WWF as both a baby face and heel.</p>
