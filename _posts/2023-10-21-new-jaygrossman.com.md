<p>Welcome to the new version of my blog!!! I migrated over 10+ years of content to a platform and a fresh (cleaner) look.</p>


<h3>The Old Blog</h3>

<p>In 2012, I was doing a lot more development in ASP.NET/C#, so I decided to move my blog to a platform that was more familiar to me. I set up my blog with  <a href="https://blogengine.io/" target="_blank">blogengine.io</a> that I self-hosted. At the time, it had some decent <a href="https://blogengine.io/features/" target="_blank">features</a> and I was able to modify a theme I liked (design shown below):</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/old_blog.png" alt="" style="border:1px solid black;" /></p>

<p>There were some things I didn't like about my set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a pain to set up and maintain.</li>
<li>It had become slower.</li>
<li>The WYSIWYG editor made some really ugly HTML.</li>
<li>The widgets were not flexible and easy to customize.<br>
(compiling old .NET to make changes was a pain).</li>
<li>A white background would be better for reading content.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Moving on to something more modern</h3>

<p>I remembered that my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/collinmeyers/" target="_blank">Collin Meyers</a> had mentioned that he <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site" target="_blank">set up a blog hosted with Github Pages</a>.  So I took a look and it looked pretty straight forward to set up.</p>

<p>Github Pages natively supports the ruby based blog framework - <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. I had never used it before, but it was very easy to set up locally with rbenv, install the gems and get it working. There were some things I immediately liked:</p>

<ul>
<li>There were plenty of themes to choose from (free and paid).<br>
I chose the <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish" target="_blank">Mediumish</a> because it was clean and simple.</li>
<li>The scripting is easy to customize the theme.</li>
<li>There are tons of examples on google and ChatGPT.</li>
<li>I can use both HTML and markdown.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many great tutorials online that will walk you through setting up a blog with Github Pages and Jekyll. I found this one to be the most helpful: <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/" target="_blank">Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a nice video I watched by Spencer Pao:</p>

<p>There were some gotchas in setting up a custom domain. Here is a helpful video from Kenny Yip:</p>

<p>Since I migrated from a different platform to Jekyll, it was helpful to set up redirects so my old URLs resolve with my new site. This GEM was helpful to set up page level redirects:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from" target="_blank">https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from</a></p>

<p>The new platfrom will certaily make it easier for me to post new content. Now I just need to find time and motivation to add more to this blog consistently.</p>
