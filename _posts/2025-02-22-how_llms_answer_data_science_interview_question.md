<p>A few weeks ago I wrote about <a href="/my_favorite_data_science_interview_question/" target="_blank">my favorite data science interview question</a>. Since so many folks are all excited about AI these days, I thought it would be fun to see how well some popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a> would answer my question.</p>

<h2>Today's LLMs are not data scientists</h2>
<p>
LLMs have the potential to transform fields like engineering and data science, but are unlikely to replace data scientists entirely. Instead, they are reshaping their roles and responsibilities by automating routine tasks and enabling a focus on higher-level strategic activities.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Show_Top_Ten_List" target="_blank">David Letterman</a> fan, here are my Top 10 Limitations of today's LLMs compared to data scientists:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Lack of True Understanding</li>
  <li>Hallucinations and Inaccuracies</li>
  <li>Dependence on Quality Data</li>
  <li>Inability to Handle Non-Textual Data</li>
  <li>Ethical and Privacy Concerns</li>
  <li>Lack of Long-Term Memory</li>
  <li>Complexity and Interpretability</li>
  <li>Selling Ideas to Stakeholders</li>
  <li>Running and Owning Experiments</li>
  <li>Don't Offer Accountability</li>
</ol>

<h2>The prompt:</h2>

<p>
<blockquote><i>I am interviewing candidates for a senior data science position at Rent the Runway (clothing rental). I am going to have a 30 minute discussion around the following question “what clothes should Rent the Runway buy for the upcoming season and at what price?”. I want you to consider that we need to support both single event (4 day) rental use cases and subscription use cases.</i></blockquote>
</p>

<p>In order to get a more suitable response, I often had to follow on with prompts with more context such as: <br/>

<blockquote><i>This is pretty high level, can you please be more detailed. This would not be an answer I would expect from a senior data scientist.</i></blockquote>

<h2>ChatGPT:</h2>
<p><a href="https://chatgpt.com/?hints=search" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> is a large language model developed by OpenAI.  It is based on the GPT-3 architecture and has been fine-tuned on a variety of conversational data.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>

<h5><b>Step 1: Understanding Customer Segments and Use Cases</b></h5>

<p>Before diving into data, the first thing a senior data scientist would do is clearly differentiate between the two primary customer segments: event rentals (4-day rentals) and subscriptions. The candidate should acknowledge that each has distinct demands.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Event Rentals (4-day use case):</b>
  <ul>
    <li>These are typically one-time, high-stakes rentals for special events like weddings, parties, galas, etc.</li>
    <li>The customer seeks high-fashion, exclusive, or trendy items.</li>
    <li><b>Key Metric:</b> Time to Rent (how early in advance are these items being rented, e.g., "3 weeks in advance for weddings").</li>
    <li><b>Key Insights:</b> Demand spikes during certain seasons (e.g., holidays, wedding season, summer parties).</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Subscription Rentals:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>These customers rent for longer periods, typically rotating through everyday or office wear, casual pieces, and sometimes seasonal clothing.</li>
    <li>The customer values variety, durability, and affordability.</li>
    <li><b>Key Metric:</b> Rental Frequency (How often do customers rent items per month? This will influence pricing and inventory management).</li>
    <li><b>Key Insights:</b> Predict which segments are more likely to upgrade to premium tiers (e.g., frequent renters looking for "newness" in their wardrobe).</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 2: Data-Driven Insights for Item Selection</h5>

<p><b>Historical Data Analysis & Forecasting</b></p>

<p>A senior data scientist would start by accessing past rental data to identify patterns and trends. This includes analyzing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Customer Behavior (Renter Profiles):</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Segment customers by demographics, frequency of rental, and historical preferences (e.g., clothing category, size, and style).</li>
      <li>For example, do women between 25-35 prefer evening wear in winter? Do frequent subscribers prefer more office-appropriate attire during fall/winter?</li> 
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Rental Demand Analysis:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for seasonality in item rentals. For instance, identify trends in demand for particular clothing items (e.g., gowns, jackets, or work blazers) over time.</li>
    <li><b>Example Model:</b> A time-series model, like <b>ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)</b>, can be used to forecast future demand for specific clothing categories or even individual items.    
     <pre>
<code>from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

model = ARIMA(rental_data, order=(5,1,0))
model_fit = model.fit()
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=4)</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li><b>Advanced Metrics to Drive Decisions:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Price Sensitivity Analysis (using historical pricing data):
    <ul>
      <li>How does price affect rental demand? Use a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forests) to assess the relationship between price and demand for different categories.</li>
      <li>An example question: Does a $50 increase in price for a designer dress reduce demand by 30%? This is important for setting optimal prices for the upcoming season.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>How does price affect rental demand?
    <ul>
      <li> Use a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forests) to assess the relationship between price and demand for different categories.</li>
      <li>An example question: Does a $50 increase in price for a designer dress reduce demand by 30%? This is important for setting optimal prices for the upcoming season.

      <pre>
<code>from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
rf.fit(features, target)
price_elasticity = rf.feature_importances_  
</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 3: Predicting Trends and Identifying</h5>

<p><b>Popular Categories for Upcoming Season</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Trend Forecasting Models:
  The senior candidate would likely consider trend forecasting algorithms such as collaborative filtering (used in recommendation systems). This helps identify emerging trends based on what similar customers are renting. A model like KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) or Matrix Factorization can be used to predict demand for certain styles or categories.

<pre>
<code>from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
model.fit(customer_rentals)
recommendations = model.kneighbors(new_customer_data)</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Seasonality Adjustment: Use a seasonality decomposition technique (like STL decomposition) to separate trend and seasonal components of historical rental data to understand how demand fluctuates across the year.

<pre>
<code>from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import STL

stl = STL(rental_data, seasonal=13)
result = stl.fit()
seasonal_demand = result.seasonal</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 4: Pricing Strategy & Optimization</h5>

<ul>
  <li><b>Dynamic Pricing for Event Rentals:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Demand Elasticity Modeling: For event rentals, optimize the price based on demand elasticity. High-demand, exclusive pieces can be priced higher, while lower-demand items (e.g., off-season or less popular sizes) should have lower prices to ensure rentals.</li>
    <li>A dynamic pricing algorithm can be implemented to adjust prices in real-time based on demand and stock levels.
<pre>
<code>from scipy.optimize import minimize

def price_optimization(prices, demand, elasticity):
    return sum(demand * (prices ** elasticity))

optimal_price = minimize(price_optimization, 
      initial_price_guess, 
      args=(demand_data, -1.5))</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Subscription Pricing Models:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Lifetime Value (LTV) Prediction: A senior data scientist would look at Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to inform subscription pricing tiers. A cohort analysis can show which types of customers are likely to stay long-term and what they are willing to pay for a subscription.</li>

<li>RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary): Segment customers based on their frequency of rentals and transaction amounts. Build a model to predict future behavior and set subscription pricing accordingly.<pre>
<code>import lifetimes

model = lifetimes.BetaGeoFitter()
model.fit(transaction_data)
predicted_LTV = model.predict(30, customer_data)</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Step 5: Operational and Inventory Considerations</h5>

<p><b>Inventory Management Optimization:</b></p>

<p>Forecasting Demand per Size/Style/Category: To avoid overstocking or stockouts, use demand forecasting models (e.g., Poisson regression) to predict demand per size/style and ensure that the inventory is stocked accordingly.

<pre>
<code>from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
model = ols('demand ~ size + category + price', data=inventory_data).fit()
forecasted_demand = model.predict(new_inventory_data)</code></pre></p>

<p><b>Replenishment Strategy:</b></p>

<p>Based on the forecasted demand, set automated replenishment triggers for high-demand items (e.g., reorder a popular dress or size once it reaches 80% utilization).</p>

<h5>Step 6: Presenting Results and Making Recommendations</h5>

<p>Finally, a senior data scientist would present the findings with actionable insights:
<ul>

<li>Item Selection: "We predict a 25% increase in demand for midi dresses, sequins, and oversized blazers based on trend analysis from customer behavior and influencer activity. These items should be prioritized for purchase in the upcoming season, especially for event renters."</li>
<li>Pricing Strategy: "For event rentals, we recommend increasing the price of exclusive designer pieces by 10-20%, while offering more budget-friendly options to capture price-sensitive customers."</li>
<li>Subscription Focus: "Subscription rentals should focus on comfortable, versatile pieces that can be worn in different settings, such as work and casual outings. We'll target medium-range priced items in popular sizes (M/L)."</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
This approach integrates advanced statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, forecasting, and operational optimization strategies, reflecting the depth and rigor expected from a senior data scientist.

<h4>My thoughts about ChatGPT's response:</h4>
<p><ul>
    <li>I expect more detail in the response for the data that candidates would be interested in using for exploring / modeling activities.</li>
    <li>I expect some focus around thinking about overall demand for a season's buy. It was interesting to see how the response focused more on thoughts around specifics user cohorts and types of products.</li>
    <li>It didn't address the "what price" aspect of the question very well. I expect some kind of basic explanation around unit economics.</li>
    <li>I was very surprised to see the response include python psuedo-code snippets. I did not find it especially helpful and I would not expect a senior data scientist to be writing code for a 30 minute presentation.</li>
    <li>I felt like much of this response was based on some incorrect assumptions about how the business operates. It leaves me curious about the data set OpenAI used to train this model.</li>

<h4>Claude's response:</h4>

<table cellpadding="10" style="border:1px solid #000000; background-color:#eeeeee;">
  <tr>
    <td>
<p>Thank you for the question. Let me approach this systematically:</p>

<p>First, I'd like to clarify that we need to make two key decisions: inventory selection and pricing strategy. For this rental model, we need to optimize both the initial purchase price and the rental price to maximize ROI while maintaining customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>Let me outline my analytical approach:</p>

<h5>1. Customer Segmentation Analysis</h5>

<p>I would first segment our customers based on:
  <ul>
    <li>Rental frequency (one-time vs. regular renters)</li>
<li>Price sensitivity (average rental value per transaction)</li>
<li>Style preferences (formal, casual, workwear)</li>
<li>Size distribution</li>
<li>Geographic location (to account for climate and local events)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Using k-means clustering on these variables, let's say we identify four primary segments:

<ul>
<li>Frequent Professional Renters (25% of customer base)</li>
<li>Special Event Renters (40%)</li>
<li>Fashion Forward Experimenters (20%)</li>
<li>Budget Conscious Occasionals (15%)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>2. Inventory Analysis</h5>
<p>For each segment, I would analyze:
<ul>
<li>Utilization rates (rentals per item)</li>
<li>Average rental duration</li>
<li>Damage/loss rates</li>
<li>Cleaning/maintenance costs</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction scores</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Key metrics I'd calculate:
<ul>
<li>Item-level ROI = (Total rental revenue - maintenance costs) / purchase price</li>
<li>Time to breakeven = Purchase price / (average daily rental rate × utilization rate)</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction impact = Net Promoter Score correlation with specific items</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5>3. Price Optimization Model</h5>
<p>I would build a mixed integer programming model with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Decision Variables:
<ul>
<li>Quantity to purchase of each style</li>
<li>Initial purchase price threshold</li>
<li>Rental price points</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Constraints:
<ul>
<li>Total budget allocation</li>
<li>Storage capacity</li>
<li>Minimum style diversity requirementsv</li>
<li>Size distribution requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Objective Function:</p>

<p>Maximize: Σ(Expected rental revenue - Purchase costs - Operating costs)</p>

<h5>4. Specific Recommendations</h5>

<p>Based on this analysis, here's what I would recommend:</p>

<p><b>Purchase Strategy:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Designer Workwear (30% of budget)
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on versatile pieces from brands like Theory and Vince</li>
      <li>Target purchase price: $150-200 (60% off retail)</li>
      <li>Expected utilization: 65% with 4-day average rental duration</li>
      <li>Target ROI: 4x purchase price within 6 months</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   <li>Premium Event Dresses (40% of budget)
    <ul>
      <li>Mix of seasonal trending designers (Zimmermann, Self-Portrait)</li>
      <li>Target purchase price: $200-300 (70% off retail)</li>
      <li>Expected utilization: 45% with 5-day average rental duration</li>
      <li>Higher margin but lower utilization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Contemporary Casual (20% of budget)
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on Instagram-trending brands</li>
      <li>Target purchase price: $80-120</li>
      <li>Expected utilization: 55%</li>
      <li>Faster inventory turnover</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Experimental/Trending (10% of budget)
    <ul>
      <li>New designers and viral styles</li>
      <li>Higher risk but important for customer acquisition</li>
      <li>Limited quantity purchases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Pricing Strategy:</b></p>

<li>Base rental price = (Purchase price × target margin × risk factor) / expected rentals</li>
<li>Risk factor varies by category (1.2 for workwear, 1.4 for event wear)</li>
<li>Dynamic pricing based on:
  <ul>
      <li>Seasonal demand (±20% adjustment)</li>
      <li>Day of week (weekend premium of 15%)</li>
      <li>Utilization rate (20% discount below 30% utilization)</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<p><b>Implementation:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Start with a pilot program of 200 SKUs across categories</li>
  <li>A/B test pricing strategies</li>
  <li>Monitor key metrics:
    <ul>
      <li>Category-level utilization rates</li>
      <li>Time to breakeven by item</li>
      <li>Customer segment satisfaction scores</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adjust purchase and pricing strategy monthly based on performance</li>
</ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p> </p>

<h4>My thoughts about Claude's response:</h4>

<p>Claude jumped into describing some more advanced concepts suggested here compared to some of the other LLMs:</p>  
<ul>
<li>I like the idea of segmenting customers with some potential features. Clustering to identify user groups is an approach our data team took.</li>

<li>Key metrics identified are all things we used.</li>

<li>Pricing optimization was too high level.</li>

<li>It is interesting the model came up with purchase strategy. I have no idea what assumptions this is based off of</li>

<li>Implementation approach wouldn't work because it doesn't consider that:
<ol>
<li>Purchase cycles are 6 months before the season</li>
<li>A/B test pricing strategies sounds good, but you will hear backlash on social media when folks see different prices for the same item. And you have to be careful with potential price discrimination.</li>
<li>For a subscription model, you can't adjust pricing monthly. You have to grandfather in existing customers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

    <td style="padding-left:35px;">
<i><p>Okay, so I need to figure out what clothes Rent the Runway should buy for the upcoming season and at what price. The interview question is for a senior data science position, so they probably expect a structured, data-driven approach. Let me start breaking this down.</p>

<p>First, Rent the Runway has two main use cases: single-event (4-day) rentals and subscriptions. I need to consider both. The goal is to determine the optimal inventory and pricing strategy.</p>

<p>I should start by thinking about the data sources available. Maybe historical rental data, customer preferences, past sales trends, inventory turnover rates, customer feedback, maybe even external data like fashion trends or economic factors. But since I don't have access to actual data, I'll have to make assumptions based on typical data science approaches.</p>

<p>For the subscription model, customers probably want a variety of options to keep their wardrobe fresh. They might prioritize versatility and current trends. Single-event renters might be looking for specific items for occasions like weddings, parties, etc. So the inventory needs might differ. Subscription items might be more about everyday wear or frequent use, while single-event could be more about statement pieces or formal wear.</p>

<p>Pricing strategies for each model might vary. Subscriptions are recurring revenue, so maybe lower per-item pricing but higher lifetime value. Single-event could be priced higher per rental but with less frequency. Need to balance inventory allocation between the two to maximize revenue without stockouts or overstock.</p>

<p>Next, think about factors influencing what to buy. Historical data on which items were popular in past seasons, maybe by region, season, event type. Also, customer demographics: age, location, preferences. For example, winter might require more coats, holiday season more party dresses. Also, considering sustainability—maybe items that can be rented multiple times without wear and tear.</p>

<p>Pricing could depend on demand elasticity. High-demand items can be priced higher. Maybe dynamic pricing based on availability and demand. Also, cost of acquisition, maintenance, cleaning, shipping. Need to ensure that the rental price covers these costs and provides a profit margin.</p>

<p>Machine learning models could help predict demand for different items. Time series analysis for seasonal trends, classification models to categorize items into high/low demand, clustering to identify customer segments. Maybe A/B testing different pricing strategies.</p>

<p>For subscriptions, understanding the churn rate and how inventory affects retention. If subscribers don't get enough variety or desired items, they might cancel. So inventory needs to align with subscriber preferences and usage patterns.</p>

<p>Inventory turnover is crucial. Items that rent quickly and frequently are better. Maybe prioritize items with high turnover rates for subscriptions to keep the inventory fresh. For single-event, items with lower turnover but higher per-rental profit might be acceptable.</p>

<p>Competitor analysis could also play a role. What are other rental services offering? How does Rent the Runway differentiate? Maybe through exclusive partnerships with designers or offering premium items.</p>

<p>Another angle: customer feedback and reviews. Analyzing reviews to see what customers liked or didn't like about past rentals. Sentiment analysis on reviews could highlight desirable features (e.g., comfort, style, fit).</p>

<p>Collaborative filtering or recommendation systems could suggest items similar to popular ones. Maybe identifying gaps in the inventory where demand isn't being met.</p>

<p>For pricing, maybe a combination of cost-plus and value-based pricing. Also, considering the rental frequency—if an item is rented multiple times, the cost per rental decreases, allowing for competitive pricing.</p>

<p>Need to balance the inventory between trendy, fast-fashion items and timeless classics. Trendy items might have high short-term demand but become obsolete quickly. Classics have longer shelf life but might not command high prices.</p>

<p>Data on returns and damages: items that are frequently damaged might not be cost-effective. Need to factor in maintenance costs when deciding to purchase.</p>

<p>Also, considering size inclusivity. Ensuring a range of sizes could attract a broader customer base and increase rental frequency.</p>

<p>Possible steps:
<ol>
<li>Analyze historical rental data to identify top-performing items in terms of revenue, frequency, customer satisfaction.</li>

<li>Segment customers into subscription vs. single-event to understand their preferences.</li>

<li>Use predictive modeling to forecast demand for different categories (e.g., dresses, outerwear) for the upcoming season.</li>

<li>Determine optimal pricing using elasticity models, considering both cost and customer willingness to pay.</li>

<li>Allocate inventory between subscription and single-event based on predicted demand and profitability.</li>

<li>Simulate different scenarios (e.g., buying more trendy vs. classic items) to assess impact on revenue and customer satisfaction.</li>

<li>Incorporate A/B testing results if available to validate assumptions.</li>

<li>Consider operational constraints like storage space, shipping logistics, and supplier lead times.</li>

</ol></p>

<p>Potential challenges: Balancing stock levels to avoid stockouts (lost revenue) and overstock (increased costs). Ensuring the pricing strategy doesn't alienate customers but remains profitable. Adapting to sudden changes in fashion trends.</p>

<p>Metrics to track: Rental frequency, customer acquisition/retention rates, profit per item, inventory turnover, customer satisfaction scores.</p>

<p>I need to present this in a structured way during the interview. Start by outlining the problem, then discuss data sources, analytical approaches, models, and considerations for both inventory and pricing. Emphasize the balance between subscription and single-use cases, and how data-driven decisions can optimize both.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>High-turnover, versatile items (e.g., blazers, midi dresses) that retain value over multiple rentals.</li>
          <li>Size inclusivity and comfort to drive retention.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Single-Event Focus:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Premium, occasion-specific items (e.g., sequin dresses, tuxedos) with higher per-rental margins.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Operational Factors:</b> Prioritize durable fabrics, ease of cleaning, and supplier partnerships for cost efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Pricing Strategy</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Dynamic Pricing:</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Subscriptions:</b> Lower per-item pricing but optimize for lifetime value (e.g., 50-100/month for 4-6 items).</li>
          <li><b>Single-Event:</b> Higher margins (e.g., 20-30% above subscription equivalent) with surge pricing for peak seasons (e.g., 150-300 for a designer gown).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Value-Based Pricing:</b> Align prices with perceived value (e.g., premium brands at 20% premium) and competitor benchmarks.</li>
      <li><b>Cost Considerations:</b> Factor in acquisition, maintenance, and logistics costs to ensure profitability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Inventory Allocation & Optimization</b>
    <ul>

      <li><b>Simulations:</b> Model scenarios (e.g., stocking more winter coats vs. holiday dresses) to maximize revenue.</li>
      <li><b>Turnover Metrics:</b> Prioritize items with >80% utilization rate for subscriptions and >50% for single-event.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li><b>Customer Experience & Retention</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Personalization:</b> Use collaborative filtering to recommend items based on user history.</li>
      <li><b>Feedback Loops:</b> Analyze returns/damage data and reviews to avoid low-quality items.</li>
      <li><b>Churn Mitigation:</b> Ensure subscription users receive desired items by maintaining a 20% buffer inventory for high-demand products.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Key Metrics & Iteration</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Track <b>rental frequency, customer lifetime value (CLV), inventory turnover,</b> and <b>profit per item</b>.</li>
      <li>Continuously update models with real-time data and iterate on pricing/inventory decisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Example Recommendation</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Buy:</b> 70% subscription-focused items (e.g., versatile blazers, jumpsuits) and 30% single-event (e.g., holiday party dresses).</li>
  <li><b>Price:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscription: 89/month for 4 items, with premium add-ons at 25/item.</li>
      <li>Single-Event: Designer gowns at 250/rental (4-day), casual dresses at 75.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>This approach balances revenue streams, minimizes stockouts, and aligns with customer expectations for both use cases.</p>

    <p>Here's a breakdown of how a strong candidate might approach the "what clothes should Rent the Runway buy for the upcoming season and at what price?" question, considering both single event (4-day) rentals and subscription use cases.  This framework emphasizes a structured, data-driven approach.</p>

<h5>I. Understanding the Business Objectives (5 minutes)</h5>

<p>A good candidate will start by clarifying the goals.  They shouldn't just jump into modeling.  They should ask questions like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"What are Rent the Runway's key performance indicators (KPIs)? Are we prioritizing revenue, profit margin, market share, customer acquisition, or something else?" (This helps understand the overall business strategy.)</li>
    <li>"What's the budget for new inventory purchases?" (Constraints are important.)</li>
    <li>"What's the risk tolerance for purchasing new inventory? Are we comfortable with higher risk/higher reward items, or do we prefer a more conservative approach?" (Important for balancing trendy vs. classic pieces.)</li>
    <li>"What is our current inventory capacity and turnover rate? Are we looking to expand our total number of items, or replace older items?" (Practical considerations.)</li>
    <li>"How does the purchasing process work? What's the lead time for ordering new items?" (Real-world constraints.)</li>
    <li>"Can you share any data on past rental performance, including rental frequency, price elasticity, and customer reviews?" (Data is crucial.)</li>
    <li>"What is the balance we are trying to strike between event rentals and subscription rentals? Are we aiming for a certain percentage split?" (Crucial for this specific question.)</li>
  </ul>

<h5>II. Data Analysis and Feature Engineering (10 minutes)</h5>

<p>This is where the candidate demonstrates their data science skills.  They should discuss the data they'd need and how they'd analyze it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Data Sources:</b>
      <ul>
          <li>Past rental data (rental dates, item details, price, customer demographics, reviews).</li>
          <li>Fashion trend data (runway reports, social media trends, influencer marketing data, competitor analysis).</li>
          <li>Customer feedback (surveys, reviews, social media sentiment).</li>
          <li>Sales data from retail partners (to understand what's selling well).</li>
          <li>Economic data (consumer spending trends).</li>
          <li>Weather forecasts (for the upcoming season).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Feature Engineering:</b> The candidate should identify relevant features:
      <ul>
          <li>Item characteristics (designer, style, color, material, size).</li>
          <li>Rental frequency (how often an item is rented).</li>
          <li>Price elasticity (how demand changes with price).</li>
          <li>Customer demographics (age, location, income).</li>
          <li>Seasonality (month of year).</li>
          <li>Trendiness score (derived from fashion data).</li>
          <li>Customer reviews and ratings.</li>
          <li>Item lifecycle (how long an item remains popular).</li>
          <li>Subscription vs. Event Rental Demand (past data on which items are preferred for which use case).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Analysis:</b>
      <ul>
          <li>Segmentation: Using clustering algorithms to group customers based on preferences and behavior.</li>
          <li>Demand forecasting: Using time series models or machine learning to predict demand for different item categories. Crucially, they should discuss how to segment this by event vs. subscription. For example, more classic pieces might be better for subscriptions, while trendy, eye-catching pieces might be better for event rentals.</li>
          <li>Price optimization: Analyzing price elasticity to determine the optimal rental price for each item. They should discuss how pricing might differ for event vs. subscription rentals.</li>
          <li>Market basket analysis: Identifying items that are frequently rented together to inform purchasing decisions.</li>
          <li>Cohort analysis: Analyzing customer behavior over time to understand preferences and churn.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h5>III. Model Building and Evaluation (7 minutes)</h5>

<p>The candidate should discuss the modeling approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Given the data and objectives, I would consider a combination of forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for demand prediction and machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) for price optimization and trend prediction."</li>
    <li>"For event rentals, I'd focus on predicting demand for specific dress types, sizes, and colors based on historical data, upcoming events (e.g., weddings, galas), and fashion trends."</li>
    <li>"For subscription rentals, I'd analyze customer preferences and create personalized recommendations to predict demand for different styles and categories."</li>
    <li>"I would evaluate the models using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for demand forecasting, and revenue or profit for price optimization."</li>
    <li>"I'd also use A/B testing to evaluate the performance of different pricing and purchasing strategies in the real world."</li>
  </ul>

<h5>IV. Recommendation and Implementation (8 minutes)</h5>

<p>The candidate should tie their analysis back to concrete recommendations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Based on the model results, I would recommend purchasing a portfolio of clothes that balances classic and trendy pieces, catering to both event and subscription rental needs."</li>
    <li>"I would prioritize items with high demand forecasts, positive customer reviews, and attractive price points."</li>
    <li>"I would also consider diversifying the inventory to cater to different customer demographics and preferences."</li>
    <li>"For event rentals, I would focus on purchasing trendy, eye-catching pieces in a range of sizes and colors."</li>
    <li>"For subscription rentals, I would focus on purchasing classic, versatile pieces that can be styled in multiple ways."</li>
    <li>"I would recommend setting different rental prices for event and subscription rentals based on demand, cost, and competitor pricing."</li>
    <li>"I would continuously monitor the performance of the new inventory and adjust the purchasing strategy based on real-world data."</li>
    <li>"Finally, I would collaborate with the buying team to ensure that the recommendations are feasible and aligned with the overall business strategy."</li>
  </ul>
<h5>Key Takeaways for the Interviewer:</h5>
  <ul>
<li>Look for a structured, data-driven approach.</li>
<li>The candidate should demonstrate a deep understanding of data science techniques and their application to business problems.</li>
<li>They should be able to communicate their ideas clearly and concisely.</li>

<table cellpadding="10" style="border:1px solid #000000; background-color:#eeeeee;">
  <tr>
    <td>
<p>Got it! Here's how a senior data scientist candidate might respond to the question, “What clothes should Rent the Runway buy for the upcoming season and at what price?” in a detailed, technical, and data-driven way:</p>

<h5>Answer from a Candidate</h5>

<p>To determine what clothes Rent the Runway (RTR) should buy for the upcoming season and at what price, I would approach this problem in three stages: data exploration and modeling, inventory optimization, and pricing strategy. Here's my step-by-step approach:</p>

<h5>1. Data Exploration and Demand Forecasting</h5>

<p>The first step is to forecast demand for different types of clothing based on historical data. I would:</p>
<ul>

  <li><b>Analyze historical rental data:</b> Look at past seasons' rental patterns segmented by:
    <ul>
      <li>Event type (e.g., weddings, galas, workwear).</li>
      <li>Subscription vs. single-event rentals.</li>
      <li>Seasonal trends (e.g., spring florals, fall neutrals).</li>
      <li>Customer demographics (age, location, size preferences).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Incorporate external data sources:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Fashion trend reports (e.g., Pantone color trends, runway shows).</li>
      <li>Social media sentiment analysis to identify trending styles or designers.</li>
      <li>Macroeconomic indicators (e.g., consumer spending trends) to predict willingness to rent luxury items.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Build a demand forecasting model:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Use time series models like SARIMA or machine learning models like Gradient Boosted Trees to predict demand for specific categories (e.g., evening gowns, jumpsuits) and designers.</li>
      <li>Incorporate covariates like seasonality, event type, and designer popularity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><u>For example:</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>If historical data shows that floral maxi dresses were highly rented in spring by single-event users, I'd prioritize similar styles while adjusting for emerging trends (e.g., midi lengths or puff sleeves).</li>
</ul>

<h5>2. Inventory Optimization</h5>

<p>Once we have demand forecasts, the next step is to optimize inventory selection to balance customer satisfaction with operational efficiency.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Single-Event Rentals:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on high-demand items that are less likely to be repeated by customers. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>Formal evening gowns for weddings or galas.</li>
          <li>Seasonal items like velvet dresses for winter holidays or pastel dresses for spring weddings.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to group customers by preferences (style, size) and ensure inventory reflects those clusters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Subscription Use Cases:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscription customers are more likely to rent versatile pieces they can wear multiple times in different contexts. I'd prioritize:
        <ul>
          <li>Workwear staples like blazers and trousers.</li>
          <li>Casual wear like sweaters or midi dresses that align with seasonal needs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To account for durability, I'd calculate the average number of rentals per item before it's retired (“rental lifespan”) and prioritize fabrics that withstand frequent use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Diversity in Inventory:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure inclusivity by offering a wide range of sizes (petite through plus-size) and styles. Historical rental data can help identify gaps where certain sizes or customer segments are underserved.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Risk Mitigation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Monte Carlo simulations to model scenarios for overstocking/understocking based on forecast uncertainty. This helps determine how much buffer inventory we need for high-demand items without overcommitting capital.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>3. Pricing Strategy</h5>

<p>Pricing must balance profitability with customer satisfaction across both use cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Single-Event Rentals:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Price elasticity modeling:</b> Analyze historical rental data to understand how sensitive customers are to price changes for different categories/designers. For instance:
        <ul>
          <li>High-end designer gowns with retail prices above $1,000 might rent for $150–$200 based on observed willingness-to-pay.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Dynamic pricing:</b> Implement dynamic pricing models that adjust rental prices based on factors like demand spikes (e.g., wedding season), inventory levels, or time until the event date.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Subscription Use Cases:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Calculate cost-per-rental (CPR):</b> For subscription items, I'd estimate CPR using:
        <ul>
          <li>CPR = Acquisition Cost / Expected Number of Rentals</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Ensure subscription items fit within RTR's tiered pricing model while maintaining profitability.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>4. Continuous Improvement</h5>

<p>Finally, I'd recommend setting up a feedback loop:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continuously monitor rental performance metrics (e.g., utilization rates, customer reviews).</li>
  <li>Adjust inventory purchases dynamically based on real-time demand signals.</li>
  <li>Experiment with A/B testing for pricing strategies or new inventory categories.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Example Output</u></p>

<p>If I were making specific recommendations based on this framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For Spring: Prioritize floral maxi dresses and pastel jumpsuits for single-event rentals; lightweight blazers and midi skirts for subscription users.</li>
  <li>Pricing: Set single-event rental prices at ~15% of retail value for high-end designers; ensure subscription items have a CPR under $10.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach ensures we maximize revenue while meeting diverse customer needs across both use cases. This answer demonstrates technical depth while tying it back to actionable insights tailored to Rent the Runway's business model.</p>

<h4>My thoughts about Perplexity's response:</h4>
<p>
I find it useful that Perplexity offers some useful follow up questions, some similar to what I found candidates asking in the past.</p>
<p>I think this answer is pretty good, a lot of useful concepts.  I would have liked to seen some discussion around unit econonmics more detailed than the simple "Calculate cost-per-rental" formula.</p>

<h4>Data-Driven Inventory and Pricing Strategy for Rent the Runway</h4>

<p>Rent the Runway (RTR) should integrate data analytics with strategic business insights to decide <b>which clothes to buy and at what price</b>. This involves a holistic approach that balances <b>demand forecasting, pricing optimization, sustainability, designer partnerships, operations, customer segmentation, and competitive trends</b>. Below is a structured strategy addressing each key factor:</p>

<h5>Customer Demand Forecasting</h5>

<p>Use data-driven forecasting to predict what styles, sizes, and designers will be most popular. RTR has a wealth of historical rental data to inform these decisions. By applying machine learning to past rentals and browsing behavior, RTR can <b>identify trends and seasonality</b> in demand and even predict customer preferences for new styles​
(<a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/rent-the-runway-wants-to-predict-your-fashion-choices-and-give-you-a-virtual-closet-will-you-let-them/#:~:text=lifetime%20value,preferences%2C%20and%20optimize%20inventory%20planning" tagret="_blank">D3.HARVARD.EDU</a>). Key actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Analyze Rental History & Trends:</b> Examine which outfits have high turn-over and positive reviews, and note seasonal spikes (e.g. weddings in spring, holidays in winter). This helps forecast demand for similar styles or upcoming designer collections. RTR already collects detailed data on rental selections and shopper tendencies (by region, age, etc.) to guide its assortment planning​
(<a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/rent-the-runway-wants-to-predict-your-fashion-choices-and-give-you-a-virtual-closet-will-you-let-them/#:~:text=As%20a%20technology,focused%20on%20increasing%20both%20the" target="_blank">D3.HARVARD.EDU</a>).</li>

<li><b>Stock Depth for High Demand:</b> Ensure the most sought-after items are purchased in greater quantities (“depth”) to avoid stockouts. Improving in-stock rates for popular items leads to a better customer experience – RTR saw a 20-point jump in Net Promoter Score after increasing inventory depth of high-demand pieces​ (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/04/10/2861090/0/en/Rent-the-Runway-Inc-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results.html#:~:text=%2A%20Increased%20inventory%20in,Q4%20%2723%20versus%20Q4%20%2722" target="_blank">GLOBENEWSWIRE.COM</a>). High availability means customers can actually rent their first-choice styles, driving satisfaction and repeat usage.</li>

<li><b>Dynamic Trend Forecasting:</b> Continuously monitor fashion trends (social media buzz, runway reports) and use predictive models to anticipate shifts in customer taste. Fashion trends can change quickly, so the inventory must be updated in near real-time with changing customer preferences​(<a href="https://www.zorp.one/blog/rent-the-runway-case-study-jit#:~:text=,updated%20with%20the%20changing%20times" target="_blank">ZORP.ONE</a>). Data science can help RTR stay ahead of these shifts by forecasting what will be in style next season, not just what was popular last season.</li>
</ul>
<p>By forecasting demand with precision, RTR can buy the <b>right styles in the right quantities</b>, minimizing overstock of low-demand items and maximizing availability of favorites.</p>

<h5>Pricing Optimization</h5>

<p>Determine the ideal rental pricing and purchase cost for each garment using data science models. Each item in RTR's inventory is an asset that generates revenue through rentals over time and then may be sold on the resale market. Optimizing pricing means maximizing the lifetime value of that asset relative to its cost. Considerations for pricing include:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Projected Rental Frequency:</b> Use demand forecasts to estimate how often an item will be rented per month. An item consistently in demand can be priced slightly higher for rentals, while a niche item might require a lower price to increase its utilization. The goal is to maximize total rentals (utilization) without sacrificing too much on price per rental. Each day an item sits idle is lost revenue, so pricing should encourage high utilization (<a href="https://www.zorp.one/blog/rent-the-runway-case-study-jit#:~:text=So%2C%20to%20get%20the%20maximum,is%20utilization%20of%20the%20asset" target="_blank">ZORP.ONE</a>).</li>

<li><b>Depreciation & Longevity:</b> Account for wear-and-tear. Every rental cycle (shipping, cleaning, wearing) slightly reduces an item's lifespan and value (<a href="https://www.zorp.one/blog/rent-the-runway-case-study-jit#:~:text=In%20simple%20terms%2C%20RTR%20has,depreciating%20value%20based%20on%20the" target="_blank">ZORP.ONE</a>). Price the rental to recoup the item's cost over its expected number of wears. For example, if a dress can realistically be rented 20 times before retiring, the rental fee structure should aim to cover the purchase cost, cleaning, and a profit within those 20 rentals. Items that last longer (higher quality or classic styles) can generate revenue over more rentals, potentially justifying a higher upfront cost.</li>

<li><b>Residual Resale Value:</b> Estimate what the garment could be sold for after its rental life (on RTR's resale platform or third-party outlets). A high resale value (for timeless or designer pieces) means RTR can pay more upfront, knowing a chunk can be recovered at resale. Data on past resale prices helps adjust the effective cost of the item. Pricing models should incorporate this salvage value to determine the net cost of ownership.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these factors, RTR can set a <b>target buy price and rental rate</b> for each item. For instance, if a dress is expected to be popular (rent often) and hold value, RTR might pay a premium to acquire it and set a moderate rental price to encourage volume. Conversely, for a trendy piece that might go out of style quickly, RTR should negotiate a lower buy cost or shorter rental window to mitigate risk. Data scientists at RTR focus on <b>profit modeling and pricing strategy</b> for inventory to hit the sweet spot in price and demand (<a href="https://resources.cdo.mit.edu/companies/rent-the-runway/jobs/45647864-data-scientist-iii-inventory" target="_blank">RESOURCES.CDO.MIT.EDU</a>). The end result is a pricing strategy that maximizes revenue per item while delivering value to customers.</p>

<h5>Sustainability Considerations</h5>

<p>Inventory decisions should align with RTR's brand as a leader in sustainable, “closet in the cloud” fashion. This means <b>prioritizing durable, high-quality garments and considering environmental impact</b> in purchasing:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Material Quality & Durability:</b> Favor clothes made from durable fabrics that can withstand frequent wearing and cleaning. Each item will be worn and dry-cleaned many times, so sturdier construction extends its rental lifespan (lower cost per wear) and reduces the need to prematurely replace stock. Investing in well-made pieces is both cost-efficient and sustainable, since it reduces waste. Industry experts note that ensuring products “get enough wear” is critical for the rental model to be truly sustainable (<a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/with-amazon-tie-up-rent-the-runway-faces-sustainability-questions#:~:text=Francois%20Souchet%2C%20global%20head%20of,to%20keep%20it%20in%20circulation" target="_blank">VOGUEBUSINESS.COM</a>). High durability directly supports profitability by increasing the number of rentals per item.</li>

<li><b>Sustainable and Ethical Sourcing:</b> Work with designers who use eco-friendly materials or processes, and consider the environmental footprint of each item (from production to eventual disposal). This might mean evaluating the supply chain of a garment or choosing materials that have lower impact. RTR markets itself as a sustainable alternative to fast fashion, so aligning inventory with those values strengthens the brand. For example, CEO Jennifer Hyman has stated that RTR aims to shift consumers away from “low-quality, unsustainable, underutilized clothing” and toward higher-quality items that get many wears (<a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/with-amazon-tie-up-rent-the-runway-faces-sustainability-questions#:~:text=Rent%20the%20Runway%20says%20its,when%20the%20partnership%20was%20first" target="_blank">VOGUEBUSINESS.COM</a>). This mission should guide buying decisions – pick styles that will last and that customers will love to rent repeatedly, rather than fleeting fast-fashion fads.</li>

<li><b>End-of-Life Recycling/Resale:</b> Plan for what happens when an item can no longer be rented. RTR already resells retired pieces and even has programs to upcycle or recycle textiles. When deciding to buy, consider if the item's materials are recyclable or if the brand has take-back programs. An item that can be responsibly disposed of (or resold easily) carries a lower environmental and financial cost in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<p>By baking sustainability into inventory decisions, RTR not only controls long-term costs (through durability and fewer replacements) but also <b>strengthens its brand reputation</b>. Customers who care about sustainability will appreciate seeing high-quality, eco-conscious garments available, creating a virtuous cycle of loyalty and positive brand image.</p>

<h5>Designer Partnerships</h5>

<p>Leverage strong relationships with designers and brands to acquire the right inventory at favorable economics. RTR should act as a strategic partner to designers, using its platform and data to create win-win deals:</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Exclusive Collections & Co-Design:</b> Collaborate with designers on exclusive capsules tailored to RTR's audience. RTR's data can inform designers about what colors, cuts, or prints will rent well (e.g., younger customers prefer bold colors over the blacks that dominate traditional retail (<a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/fashion-brands-are-developing-deeper-relationships-with-rental-platforms/#:~:text=The%20process%20allows%20Rent%20the,assortment%20is%20a%20bright%20color" target="_blank">GLOSSY.CO</a>). Through the “Designer Collective” program, RTR has co-produced lines with names like Jason Wu and Derek Lam, tweaking designs to suit rental customers (<a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/fashion-brands-are-developing-deeper-relationships-with-rental-platforms/#:~:text=Designers%20like%20Derek%20Lam%20and,Victor%20Alfaro%20and%20Prabal%20Gurung" target="_blank">GLOSSY.CO</a>). These exclusive pieces differentiate RTR's inventory (you can only get them through RTR) and often have high appeal, driving up rentals. Exclusivity also allows RTR to control supply and potentially negotiate better prices since it's a collaborative creation.</li>

<li><b>Revenue-Sharing Models:</b> Where possible, reduce upfront inventory costs by entering revenue-share agreements with brands. In such deals, designers provide inventory to RTR at little or no initial cost, and both parties split the rental revenue each time the item is rented (<a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/fashion-brands-are-developing-deeper-relationships-with-rental-platforms/#:~:text=Even%20more%20notable%20is%20Rent,wear%20measurement%20to%20determine%20revenue" target="_blank">GLOSSY.CO</a>). This aligns incentives: designers earn more if their pieces are rented frequently, and RTR lowers the risk if an item underperforms. In fact, as of 2020 about 36% of RTR's items were obtained via revenue share instead of outright purchase (<a href="https://www.drivepoint.io/post/rent-the-runway-s-1#:~:text=Founded%20in%202009%20by%20Jennifer,18" target="_blank">DRIVEPOINT.IO</a>), showing how important these partnerships are to the business model. By negotiating smart revenue split terms (based on cost-per-wear metrics, for example), RTR can offer a wider variety of styles while keeping cash expenditures down.</li>

<li><b>Bulk Purchasing & Favorable Terms:</b> For styles that are proven hits, negotiate volume discounts. RTR has grown to where it can be one of a brand's largest wholesale buyers, sometimes ordering <b>hundreds of units</b> of a single style
(<a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/fashion-brands-are-developing-deeper-relationships-with-rental-platforms/#:~:text=Many%20brands%20were%20first%20lured,the%20brand%E2%80%99s%20largest%20wholesale%20partner" target="_blank">GLOSSY.CO</a>). This purchasing power can be used to get better pricing (lower cost per unit) or priority production from the brand. Additionally, negotiate terms like exchange or return allowances - e.g., the ability to return unsold inventory or swap out styles that aren't renting, or marketing support from designers. The aim is to<b>share the risk</b> and reward with brand partners, so both sides benefit from popular items and are protected if trends shift.</li>
</ul>
<p>By working closely with 750+ designer partners (<a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/about-us/product?srsltid=AfmBOoo5qti_zvMs2ZRpdCZpw4GLHpldT0umttcjfwFWaQi85EJB9K0o" target="_blank">RENTTHERUNWAY.COM</a>), Rent the Runway can ensure a pipeline of fresh, high-ROI inventory. The strategy is to procure must-have fashions in a cost-effective way, whether by co-designing unique items or structuring deals that reduce upfront costs. Strong partnerships backed by data (which RTR can share with designers to inform their future collections) create a competitive advantage that's hard to copy.</p>

<h5>Logistics & Operational Constraints</h5>

<p>Any inventory decision must be feasible to manage operationally. RTR's business isn't just buying clothes - it's about storing, cleaning, and shipping them efficiently in a continuous cycle. Key operational factors to consider when deciding what to buy:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Warehouse Capacity & Distribution:</b> There is a physical limit to how many items RTR's warehouses can hold and how quickly staff can process them. Before buying large quantities of a new style, RTR must ensure it has space and a plan for distribution across its warehouses to meet regional demand. The inventory team uses data to balance stock across locations (<a href="https://resources.cdo.mit.edu/companies/rent-the-runway/jobs/45647864-data-scientist-iii-inventory#:~:text=are%20looking%20for%20a%20Data,to%20drive%20serious%20business%20impact" target="_blank">RESOURCES.CDO.MIT.EDU</a>) so that items are near the customers who want them. If a certain style will primarily be popular in New York, for example, ensure ample units are stocked in the Northeast warehouse. Efficient allocation prevents bottlenecks and reduces shipping time/cost.</li>


<li><b>Cleaning & Turnaround Time:</b> Each rental triggers reverse logistics - the item comes back, needs inspection, washing, any repairs, and then restocking. This turnaround time is critical. RTR should <b>evaluate how easily a garment can be cleaned and how quickly it can be made rental-ready again</b> when choosing it for the inventory. Fabrics like silk or intricate beading might require special care (slower turnaround and higher cost), whereas a durable jersey dress can be cleaned and returned to stock in a day. RTR has invested in massive laundry facilities (cleaning ~6,000 units of clothing per hour) to speed this up (<a href="https://www.zorp.one/blog/rent-the-runway-case-study-jit#:~:text=Rent%20the%20runway%20processes%2060,units%20of%20apparel%20per%20hour" target="_blank">ZORP.ONE</a>). Still, if an item can't be quickly processed (or has high cleaning costs), it affects how many of that item RTR should carry. The faster an item can be returned to circulation, the fewer total units are needed to satisfy demand. (Notably, RTR's operations are so refined that 60% of returned items are processed and sent back out on the same day<a href="https://www.zorp.one/blog/rent-the-runway-case-study-jit#:~:text=Rent%20the%20runway%20processes%2060,units%20of%20apparel%20per%20hour" target="_blank">ZORP.ONE</a>), illustrating how critical fast turnaround is to their model.)</li>

<li><b>Repairability & Maintenance:</b> Some garments will inevitably incur damage or wear. Before buying, consider if the item is easily repairable. Can missing sequins be replaced or zippers fixed by the in-house repair team? Items that survive the rental cycle with minor, fixable issues are preferable. Also factor in the cost of maintenance – e.g., will this leather jacket require periodic conditioning? RTR's goal is to minimize downtime for each piece; high-maintenance items might spend too long off the shelf being repaired, which hurts their profitability.</li>

<li><b>SKU Management & Assortment Complexity:</b> RTR offers hundreds of thousands of SKUs across many designers (<a href="https://www.drivepoint.io/post/rent-the-runway-s-1#:~:text=The%20logistics%20behind%20this%20business,supply%20chain%20management%2C%20and%20finance" target="_blank">DRIVEPOINT.IO</a>). Managing too broad an assortment can strain operations - tracking each item, ensuring each has steady demand, and not overwhelming customers with choice. When deciding what new clothes to buy, RTR should ensure they fill a clear need (either replacing aging stock or adding something novel) and won't create unnecessary complexity. Sometimes focusing on fewer styles with deeper stock is operationally wiser than having one of everything. This was the idea behind RTR's “depth strategy” - fewer styles, more units of each - which improved fulfillment efficiency and customer satisfaction (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/04/10/2861090/0/en/Rent-the-Runway-Inc-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2023-Results.html#:~:text=%2A%20Increased%20inventory%20in,Q4%20%2723%20versus%20Q4%20%2722" target="_blank">GLOBENEWSWIRE.COM</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, <b>practical execution matters</b>. Even the most fashionable dress is a bad investment if it's too costly or slow to handle in the rental cycle. RTR should thus choose inventory that fits within its logistical capabilities, and continually invest in operations (techniques like just-in-time processing, automated sorting, etc.) to expand those capabilities (<a href="https://www.zorp.one/blog/rent-the-runway-case-study-jit#:~:text=Model%20to%20predict%20the%20future,available%20inventory" target="_blank">ZORP.ONE</a>)  (<a href="https://www.zorp.one/blog/rent-the-runway-case-study-jit#:~:text=Automated%20Inspection%3A" target="_blank">ZORP.ONE</a>). Aligning inventory strategy with operational capacity ensures high utilization of each item and a smooth experience for customers.</p>

<h5>Customer Segmentation & Personalization</h5>

<p>Rent the Runway serves a diverse customer base with different tastes and occasions – from young professionals needing work attire to bridesmaids seeking dresses for a wedding. Making smart buying decisions means curating inventory for key customer segments and personalizing the experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Segment-Specific Curation:</b> Analyze the data to understand distinct customer groups and their preferences. For example, RTR's core subscribers might skew younger (late 20s to 30s) and fashion-forward, whereas one-time renters for formal events might prefer classic, conservative gowns. Data can reveal what styles/colors each segment favors. (The contrast is evident: the average RTR customer is 29 and loves bright colors, whereas traditional luxury retail skews age 50+ with mostly black garments (<a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/fashion-brands-are-developing-deeper-relationships-with-rental-platforms/#:~:text=The%20process%20allows%20Rent%20the,assortment%20is%20a%20bright%20color" target="_blank">GLOSSY.CO</a>).) RTR should ensure its buying reflects these insights - e.g., maintain a robust selection of vibrant, trendy pieces in sizes and silhouettes popular with Millennials, while also stocking elegant, timeless outfits for those renting occasion wear. If a high-value segment (say, new moms, plus-size customers, or customers in a particular city) is underserved, RTR can target buying to fill those gaps.</li>

<li><b>Personalized Recommendations & Feedback Loop:</b> RTR's data doesn't just guide what to buy, it also can guide to whom to show which items. The company uses algorithms to recommend clothes to users based on their style history and similar users' behavior (<a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/rent-the-runway-wants-to-predict-your-fashion-choices-and-give-you-a-virtual-closet-will-you-let-them/#:~:text=RTR%20founders%20,data%20RTR%20can%20identify%20trends" target="_blank">D3.HARVARD.EDU</a>). When customers consistently gravitate toward certain designers or styles, that signals RTR to stock more of those. Likewise, if a segment isn't engaging with a category (for instance, petite customers not renting jumpsuits due to fit issues), RTR can adjust future buys. Encourage customers to leave reviews and fit feedback; this qualitative data helps refine the inventory to better suit each segment's needs. Over time, this creates a personalization flywheel - the more RTR learns about its customers, the more precisely it can buy inventory that delights them.</li>

<li><b>Elevating Customer Lifetime Value:</b> By aligning inventory with customer segments, RTR can increase satisfaction and retention of those users. For instance, having a reliably great selection for workwear-oriented subscribers will keep that segment subscribing longer (increasing lifetime value). Data-driven segmentation ensures high-value customers see inventory that resonates with them, making them more likely to rent more items and stay loyal. This strategic curation by segment is a form of personalization at the inventory level, complementing the on-site personalization.</li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, <b>know your customer segments intimately and buy accordingly</b>. RTR's competitive edge is bolstered by the richness of its customer data - it knows what a 30-year-old fashionista in NYC likes versus a 40-year-old professional in Chicago. By using these insights, RTR stocks the closet in a way that feels personalized to each member, increasing usage and satisfaction across the board.</p>

<h5>Competitive Benchmarking</h5>

<p>Finally, RTR should continuously scan the competitive landscape and broader market trends to inform its inventory strategy. The fashion rental space has grown and evolved, with multiple players and shifting consumer expectations. Key points here include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Monitoring Market Trends:</b> Keep a pulse on what's happening in fashion overall – not just high fashion trends, but also consumer behavior trends like the rise of casual wear, remote-work clothing needs, or resurgence of certain styles (e.g. 90s fashion comeback). RTR's buying should anticipate these trends so that customers find the latest looks on the platform. If neon suits or sustainable athleisure are predicted to be big next season, RTR should be ready with those in the inventory. Being first to offer emerging trends can attract customers and differentiate RTR from competitors. Conversely, if a trend is fading, RTR should be cautious about investing too much in those items (to avoid ending up with inventory no one rents).</li>

<li><b>Analyzing Competitors' Offerings:</b> Regularly review what other fashion rental services (and luxury subscription boxes) are carrying. If competitors offer certain designers or categories that RTR doesn't, evaluate if there's a strategic need to match or counter that. For example, if a rival rental company is succeeding with a maternity rental line or men's formalwear, RTR could consider whether to enter those areas or double down on its core women's fashion with even better selection. The goal is not to copy competitors, but to ensure RTR remains the <b>market leader in breadth and quality of choice</b>. If others innovate (like a new partnership or a tech-enabled fitting solution), RTR should learn from it and aim to do it better.</li>

<li><b>Benchmarking Pricing and Experience:</b> Competitive intelligence also extends to pricing models and user experience. RTR should be aware of how others price similar items or subscriptions. This doesn't mean a race to the bottom on price, but understanding the value proposition. If RTR charges a premium, it must justify it with superior selection or service. Data on the competitive rental market (size, growth (<a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/technology/fashion-rentals-make-or-break-year#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8BThe%20global%20online%20clothing%20rental,by%202030%2C%20says%20Grand" target="_blank">VOGUEBUSINESS.COM</a>), consumer adoption rates) can help RTR position itself wisely. Additionally, watching competitors helps RTR spot new opportunities or threats early - for instance, if peer-to-peer clothing rental or specialized niche rentals start gaining traction, RTR can strategize accordingly (either by partnering, acquiring, or adjusting its own model).</li>
</ul>
<p>By <b>staying vigilant about industry movements</b>, RTR can adapt its inventory purchases proactively rather than reactively. This external lens, combined with internal data, ensures RTR's strategy isn't formed in a vacuum. It will help answer questions like: Are there must-have designers or collections that everyone is carrying this season? Is there a trend in rental (or resale) that RTR needs to invest in (such as more casual everyday wear as opposed to occasion wear)? Continual benchmarking guarantees that RTR offers a compelling, up-to-date selection and remains one step ahead of customer expectations.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

In conclusion, Rent the Runway should make inventory purchase and pricing decisions through a <b>blend of data-driven analysis and strategic foresight</b>. By forecasting customer demand with precision, optimizing pricing for lifetime value, upholding sustainability and quality, partnering smartly with designers, aligning with operational capacities, catering to key customer segments, and keeping an eye on the market, RTR can curate a rental collection that delights customers and drives profitable growth. This holistic approach ensures that <b>every item RTR buys earns its keep</b> - attracting renters, justifying its cost through multiple wears, and reinforcing Rent the Runway's position as the premier “closet in the cloud.” Each decision, backed by data and strategic thinking, will help RTR continue innovating in the fashion rental industry while moving toward sustainable profitability.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Overall, I think many of the responses were pretty good. I think LLMs provide a solid starting point for researching a new subject area. They brought up some not obvious considerations that many folks might not think of.</p> 

<p><b>I would NOT consider today's LLM offerings capable of replacing a good data scientist!!!</b> No matter how much some LinkedIn influencers and tech blogs try to convince you that LLMs can be a cost efficient alternative.</p>
